          <h2>What is the ECB’s mission?</h2>
          <p>
            The European Central Bank (ECB) is in charge of the euro and helps guide the EU’s economic and financial decisions. Its main goal is to keep prices stable, which helps the economy grow and creates jobs.
          </p>

          <h2>What does the ECB do?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Sets the interest rates for loans to banks in the eurozone to help control inflation and the amount of money in the economy</li>
            <li>Manages the eurozone’s foreign currency reserves and buys or sells currencies to keep exchange rates balanced</li>
            <li>Makes sure national authorities properly supervise banks and financial markets, and that payment systems work smoothly</li>
            <li>Works to keep the European banking system safe and secure</li>
            <li>Approves the production of euro banknotes in eurozone countries</li>
            <li>Tracks prices and looks for risks that could cause prices to become unstable</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How does the ECB manage the economy?</h2>
          <p>
            The ECB uses different tools to control how much money is in the economy and to keep prices stable. These tools help fight inflation (prices rising too fast) or deflation (prices falling too much).
          </p>
          <h3>Main tools the ECB uses:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Interest Rates</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>The ECB sets the interest rate for loans to banks</li>
                <li>Lower rates make borrowing cheaper, so people and businesses spend more</li>
                <li>Higher rates make borrowing more expensive, so spending slows down</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Buying and Selling Bonds (Open Market Operations)</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>The ECB buys or sells government bonds</li>
                <li>Buying bonds puts more money into the economy</li>
                <li>Selling bonds takes money out of the economy</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reserve Requirements</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>The ECB tells banks how much money they must keep (instead of lending out)</li>
                <li>Lower reserve means banks can lend more so there is more money in the economy</li>
                <li>Higher reserve means banks lend less so there is less money in the economy</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How does the ECB work, who is in charge?</h2>
          <p>
            The ECB, in collaboration with the national central banks of all EU countries, form the European System of Central Banks.
          </p>
          <p>
            It helps guide relations and cooperations between all central banks in the eurozone. This is referred to as the Eurosystem.
          </p>
          <p>It consists of:</p>
          <h3>The Governing Council</h3>
          <p>
            Consisting of the executive board and the governors of eurozone country national central banks, it’s role is to define eurozone monetary policy, fix interest rates at which commercial banks can borrow from the ECB and assess economic and monetary developments. It is the decision making body of the ECB.
          </p>
          <h3>The Executive Board</h3>
          <p>
            With the ECB President, Vice-President and four other members appointed by the leaders of the eurozone countries. It implements monetary policy while managing day-to-day operations, and prepares Governing Council meetings and exercises powers delegated to it by the Governing Council. It handles the day-to-day running of the ECB.
          </p>
          <h3>The General Council</h3>
          <p>
            The council consists of the ECB President, Vice-President and governors of central banks from all EU countries. It’s job is to contribute to advisory and coordination work, it helps to prepare for new countries joining the euro. It primarily has an advisory & coordination role.
          </p>

          <h2>How are decisions agreed upon?</h2>
          <p>
            The Governing Council meets every 6 weeks to review the economy and decide what actions are needed (like changing interest rates). Here, the decisions are usually made by majority vote. All members have one vote, no matter how big or small their country is.
          </p>
          <p>
            This system helps the ECB make fair and informed decisions to keep the euro area stable and strong.
          </p>

        <h2>Why We Created ECB Lens</h2>
        <p>
          As high school students at the Cité Scolaire Internationale de Lyon, we noticed that many of our peers and families struggled to understand how ECB decisions affected their daily lives. Interest rate changes impact everything from mortgage payments to savings account returns, yet the connection often feels abstract and distant.
        </p>
        <p>
          We created ECB Lens to bridge this gap. Our platform combines real-time data, interactive visualizations, and clear explanations to make European Central Bank policy accessible to students, young professionals, and small business owners who are directly affected by these decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          By breaking down complex monetary policy concepts and showing their real-world implications, we hope to empower people to make better financial decisions and engage more meaningfully with economic news and policy discussions.

            What is the difference between the three ECB rates?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            The Main Refinancing Rate is the rate at which banks borrow from the ECB, the Deposit Facility Rate is what banks earn for depositing money overnight, and the Marginal Lending Rate is what banks pay for emergency overnight borrowing. Together, they create a corridor that influences all other interest rates in the economy.

            How often does the ECB meet to make decisions?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            The ECB Governing Council meets every six weeks, typically on the first Thursday of each month. Rate decisions are announced at 14:15 CET on the day of the meeting, followed by a press conference with the ECB President.

          <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">
            Why does the ECB target 2% inflation?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            The 2% target provides a buffer against deflation (falling prices) while being low enough to maintain price stability. This level allows for economic growth while preventing the harmful effects of high inflation on purchasing power and economic planning.
